    <h1> Welcome to my world,<span class="jazzberry"> a world where dreams come true</span>.</h1>
    <h3> My greatest strengths: creativity, logic, speed and never giving up. </h3>
    <p> My dream is to become independent, quit my pay the bills job and live off writing books, my blog and being an instagram creator. Since that all takes some doing and that takes time, I am living two lives at once, parallel, if you want. And I can tell you, it's not easy. Sometimes it's life and pure energy. Sometimes it seems to tear me apart with a force that has no equal on this earth.  </p>

    <h2> MY DREAM </h2>
    <h4> My dream is to become a writer and live a happy life. </h4>
    <p> Now, how am I gonna do that? How am i gonna achieve my dream? Well, I guess the answer is as simple as it is difficult: By working hard on making it come true. I've done that for a few years now. Ever since the idea first entered my mind and set fire to my heart. That was some years ago now. And yes, I haven't always been working hard for it. But I guess, that's normal, isn't it? Sometimes you go all for it. And sometimes it's just too much and you let it slack a little. But that's ok too, as long as you just don't give up on your dream. Just keep working on it. </p>

    <h3> Blogger </h3>
    <p class="jazzberry"> 2019 to present: Thinking of writing a blog about life </p>
    <p> About the same time I decided I wanted to become an Instagram Influencer, I decided I wanted to create my own personal blog. I have been entertaining that idea a while before that already but 2019 I thought "Yeah, why not? Why wait? Let's give it a try!" </p>
